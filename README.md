# amberNPS
A QSAR-based app for the prediction of lethal blood concentration of New Psychoactive Substances

## Overview
amberNPS is a web-based tool developed to predict the lethal blood concentrations (LBCs) of New Psychoactive Substances (NPS) across different classes. The tool utilizes quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling, incorporating machine learning algorithms, to correlate structural information of NPS with post-mortem blood levels. 

## Features
- **LBC Prediction:** Predicts the LBCs of NPS within opioid, benzodiazepine, cathinone, synthetic cannabinoid, and phenylethylamine classes.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy input via SMILES notations for quick predictions.

## Usage
- Access the amberNPS web application at [URL to be defined].
- Input the SMILES notation of the molecule of interest.
- Click the Calculate button or hit Enter to obtain the predicted LBC range.
